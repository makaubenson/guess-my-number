## DOCUMENT OBJECT MODEL(DOM) Manipulation

- DOM is the structured representation of HTML documents. Allows javascript to access HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.
- DOM manipulation is basically making Javascript interact with the web browser.
- DOM always starts with the `document object`.
- A `DOCUMENT` is a special object that is the entry point to the DOM. e.g `document.querySelector()`
- DOCUMENT has one main element which is the `html`
- RULE: `whatever is in the html is also in the DOM`
- DOM !== JAVASCRIPT
- The DOM and The DOM methods & properties are part of `WEB APIs`
- API stands for Application Programming Interface.
- The DOM also constitutes `CSS`.
- Manipulating html styles using `js` requires one to set the value as a string always. e.g `document.querySelector('.number').style.width = '30rem';` that is `'30rem'`

## Handling Click Events

- An `event` is something that happens on the page.
